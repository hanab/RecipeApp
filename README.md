### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features
 - The application shows a list of recipes in a list view (grid view), each item shows the image, name, and cusine
 - When clicking on the list view item, a detail view that contains the large image, name, cusine, source link, and youtube video link appears
 - When clicking on a sorce link, the link opens in the browser showing the recipe 
 - Clicking on the video plays the video in full screen mode

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
- My main focus was structuring the application well and creating a testable code using protocol oriented architecture 
- The reason I chose to focus on this is that it is important to write testable code when working in a team enviroment so that bugs can be caught in early and also well structured code imporoves readablity and collaberation
- I also focused on building the mimimum requirements well

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
 - I spend approximately 4 hours. I would say I spend about an hour for structuring the project and creating the network classes, 1 hour for buildning UI, 1 hour for image caching, and 1 hour for testing.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
 - I used minimal UI elements and avoided heavy anmiation to focus on clarity and writing readable well structured code
 - I also focused on writing testable code instead of spending more time on UI
 - Tests were written using mock json data instead of real API data so that tests are stable and work as expected all the time
      
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
- The UI for the detail view needs more work, espcially the webview for loading youtbue videos and also in landscape mode the UI can be imporved to have a diffrent design or landscape mode can be disbaled.
